**Student Performance Analysis and Placement Prediction**

This project leverages machine learning and data integration to provide a comprehensive evaluation of students' performance. It combines academic records, online coding profiles from competitive programming platforms (Codeforces, CodeChef, and LeetCode), and project experience to calculate placement probabilities and provide actionable insights for students, educators, and placement cells.

**Features**

1. Automated Data Integration:
Fetch online coding performance metrics via APIs and web scraping.
Combine academic scores, project experience, and coding data for holistic analysis.

2. Performance Analysis:
DSA Evaluation: Classify students as "Expert," "Good," or "Needs Improvement" based on their competitive programming performance.
Academic Assessment: Analyze CGPA, semester marks, and backlogs for academic insights.
Project Experience: Evaluate the number of completed projects to assess hands-on experience.

3. Placement Prediction:
Use a weighted scoring system to compute overall placement probabilities.
Train a Random Forest Classifier for predictive modeling.

4. Data Visualization:
Generate graphs for DSA performance, academic trends, and LeetCode submission stats.

5. No Interactive Input Required:
The system processes preloaded datasets and fetches live data automatically.
